## Are You a Coder or a Programmer?

I see so many out there who refer to themselves as programmers simply because they can write some basic codes. Just like I heard someone say few days back that:

> I am a programmerüòä, I write HTML programming language.

üòÇüòÇHilarious right? 
 
I think it's cool to know the difference between these two terms.

### WHO IS A CODER?

A Coder is basically **anyone** who writes code. If you write HTML codes, you're an HTML coder. A Coder is the least level of developing software applications. If you're given a simple application to work on and you can't draw out how the application should work or you need someone else to do that before you can write the codes, you are a coder and not a programmer. 

Similarly, a Coder only deals with the codes, and so, his or her task can be less intimidating or less intensive compared to that of a programmer.

### WHO IS A PROGRAMMER?

A programmer is a person who writes codes for computer programs and mobile applications. Not only does he write codes, he is also involved in maintaining, debugging and troubleshooting systems and software to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

Also, a Programmer is capable of writing more sophisticated codes than a coder.

### WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THESE TWO(2) TERMINOLOGIES?

I conducted a short survey to know others opinion and these are part of the responses I got.

He said, a Coder is the least rank or experience level of Programmers, meaning that all Programmers are Coders but not all Coders are ProgrammersüòÄ. He explained better in [this](https://unclebigbay.com/terminologies-in-web-and-software-engineering-explained) article he wrote.

**Miss Anonymous** from #techtwitter who has categorically informed me not to disclose her identityüòÄ said:

> A Coder writes codes, a Programmer also writes codes...

...meaning, **Miss Anonymous** sees no difference between a Coder and a ProgrammerüòÅ.

Lastly, let's read what [Ibraheem](https://ingenious_02?s=09) from #techtwitter has to tell us:

In summary, **Ibraheem** thinks a Coder writes codes only to perform a specific task, while a Programmer writes codes to build an app or a websiteü§≠...

**Thank you all for the feedbacks!**

### CONCLUSION 

To wrap up this article, I'll say coding is a branch of programming because programming involves more than just coding, it also involves **data structures**, **problem solving**, **algorithms** and the likes.

I am sure after reading up to this part of the article, you vividly know the category you belong.
