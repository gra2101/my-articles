## Web Technology

Hey there! In this article, I will briefly explain what **Web Technology** is all about.

### WHAT IS WEB TECHNOLOGY?

Web technology is simply referred to as the means by which computers communicate with each other. It involves the use of HTML and CSS alongside graphics and scripting.

### HOW DOES WEB TECHNOLOGY WORK?

Web browers like Google chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc... work by connecting to the internet through a MODEM or an Internet Service Provider **ISP**, to a remote computer or web server to get a particular document or page. When we make a search on a web browser, it fetches the web page of what we are searching for from the server by a **request**. A **request** is a standard HTTP containing a **page address**. A** page address** is used to locate a page from the web server and it looks typically like this ```http://www.someone.com/index.html```
